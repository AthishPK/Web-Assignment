	<h1>Conclusion</h1>
	<p>In the first term of our web development we studied how to develop a webpage using the html codes. It was interactive and was user friendly for use to code the webpage. We were able to develop a webpage using the code in the html. The web development was very interactive and was user friendly so that we were able to code the programming easily without any fault. It also helped us to gain knowledge about the instances in the html codes and to create a new webpage and we were able to find a solution for the coding of the program. I found learning sources like w3school where the best when you are just getting started. Just be advised that this method of learning gets more interactive when we get used to it. We can do responsive design without any additional framework, but its far easier with the help of a responsive framework like CSS. We got a well-developed knowledge about using html and was simpler for me to code a webpage after reading the code given by the html and was able to create a webpage of our own.</p>
	<p>The wireframe image of the webpage is given below </p>
     <p><img src="Wire frame.png" alt="wire frame" width= "450" width= "420">
     <p>When we started doing the assignment we took in design elements from material design and we also used all
the information and knowledge gained from the classes of web development.</p>
<p>When we were given the assignment, we came with our own ideas and vision, some of them could be easily
implemented while some are difficult to implement</p>
